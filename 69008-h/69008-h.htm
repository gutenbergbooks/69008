<p class="hanging3"><i>REPORT AND RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY THE CHAMBER OF
COMMERCE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, DECEMBER
6, 1889.</i></p>


<hr class="tb" />

<p>The committee on Foreign Commerce and the Revenue
Laws, to which was referred a communication from Mr. C. P.
Huntington relating to the Chinese Exclusion Act, submits
the following report:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>by a letter addressed to Mr. A. A. Low, a member of the Chamber,
by Mr. C. P. Huntington, also a member, and by Mr. Low referred
to the Chamber. As this letter is the basis of our inquiry and
embodies the views of many of the people of the United States,
it is proper that it should be given in full. It is as follows:</p>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">New York</span>, November 24th, 1888.</p>

<p class="p0">A. A. Low, Esq.,<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Burling Slip, New York City.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Dear Sir:</i> I do not carry in my mind whether you have altogether retired
from the China trade; but I know you still have a keen interest in the national
prosperity and in the dignity and honor of this Government. I suppose you felt
as most other people did, last summer, when Congress passed the Chinese
Exclusion Act, that it was an unworthy proceeding which nothing but the necessities
of a partisan struggle could have brought about It may have been foreseen,
and perhaps was pointed out at the time, that the Government of China had it in
its power to inflict far more serious harm upon our country than we could upon
China, even supposing that the coming of the Chinese was the injury to our laboring
people which was charged. It seems that without uttering a word or lifting
a finger the Chinese are enabled to retaliate effectively against our commerce; so
that we have not only offered them a wanton affront, but also injured ourselves la
a twofold way, by excluding a tractable and cheap labor which we very much
need to build up our desolate places; and by the loss of a valuable trade which we
might have kept to the exclusion of our rivals. A gentleman direct from Chinese
and Japanese ports tells me that since the news of the passage of the Exclusion
Act reached China American agents there have been unable to sell any of the
coarser cotton textile fabrics, of which they had been taking large quantities.
Their wants are supplied from other sources; England, I suppose. They offer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">- 4 -</span>
no explanation for this change of policy, but simply say they are not baying.
Just as soon as they can supply themselves with petroleum from Asiatic oil wells
we may expect that trade to follow. Clocks and machinery can be supplied by
the English and Germans who would be glad to relieve us of the trade. The tea,
mattings, raw silks and other commodities which we need and can buy nowhere
else, Americans will have to pay for in coin, or exchange on London, when we
might have paid for them with our own products.</p>

<p>Is not this, a heavy price to pay for the luxury of the hoodlum vote of California.
It is to be hoped that the expiring Congress will find time to undo this
pernicious piece of spiteful legislation; or, if not, that the incoming administration
will so interpret the law and instruct its ministers so as to restore the lost amity.
Just how this is to be brought about, you know as much as I do.</p>

<p>It occurs to me that the New York Chamber of Commerce might properly
speak on this subject, and I know of no one so well fitted as yourself to move
in this matter. If you will undertake it, please do so; and if I can be of any
assistance to you in the matter, I shall cheerfully render it. It seems to me this
is a clear case where patriotic duty calls for prompt action.</p>

<p class="tdr">Very respectfully yours,<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;C. P. HUNTINGTON<br />

</div>

<p>That the sentiments of this letter are not peculiar to its author,
but are shared by many others in all parts of the United
States, is manifest from the following expressions taken from
prominent public journals.</p>

<p>The <i>Commercial</i>, of Louisville, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Chinese question is receiving a larger share of public attention as it becomes
apparent that the ill effects of the Exclusion Act are manifold and certain,
while it is exceedingly doubtful whether 'exclusion' can really be accomplished."</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Bulletin</i>, of Providence, R. I., says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"For the inspiration of the whole disgraceful business was not the public
welfare nor the public dignity, but the desire to advance public party interests by
satisfying a clamoring crowd of Pacific coast voters. With few exceptions the
leaders of either party were only too eager to grant whatever the sand lot crowd
of San Francisco desired. * * * So generally was this understood that the
harsh construction put upon the act in the late administration was accepted without
question everywhere as fairly embodying the purpose of Congress; and no
one, even among those who deplored the law and felt humiliated in their citizenship
by it, ever thought to doubt the correctness of the decision, but looked upon
it as the natural conclusion to a piece of shameful demagogism.</p>

<p>"Some day, doubtless, we shall learn that by insulting a sensitive people
who are essential to the development of our commerce on the Pacific, and who
might have been made valuable customers, we have spited nobody so much as
ourselves."</p>

<p>"The San Francisco <i>Report</i>," says the Atlanta <i>Journal</i>, "has amended the
California slogan, 'The Chinese must go.' It says that the agriculturists who
cannot get along without them must also go; that 'if they have become so far
demoralized as to prefer to associate with yellow slaves rather than with their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">- 5 -</span>
fellow-countrymen, California can hardly be a desirable place of residence for
them.' Isn't it about time to consider whether we are not pushing to hurtful extremes
the policy of excluding workingmen from this country."</p>

<p>"The St Paul <i>Pioneer Press</i> characterizes the regulation forbidding Chinese
laborers from landing at American ports, for any purpose whatever, as being
'about as stringent as the old anti-Huguenot laws of France.' And that paper
goes on to say, 'It is to the material interest of this country to cultivate friendly
relations with China. We want her trade, now largely going to Great Britain,
but we cannot expect to get it by hurling exclusion acts at her. As a matter of
fact the anti-Chinese laws now existing have not kept many Chinese out of the
country. They come in with the greatest ease through British Columbia and
Mexico. There are just as many Chinese in the country as there were in 1880.
This is the result of about forty years' Immigration. And, as these people cling
more fondly to their native heath than any other in the world, the dangers of their
overrunning this continent, even if all its ports were thrown open to them, is altogether
imaginary."</p>

<p>The Omaha <i>Bee</i> declares that "the matter possesses the interest of an International
question, the decision of which will hardly fall to have a more or less
important bearing upon our future relations with China;" and "the Chinese
government may reasonably be expected to regard the discrimination against
Its people as evidence of a seated hostility to them which self-respect would
compel it to resent. Chinese merchants have already done so to the detriment
of our commerce with China, but a further evidence of American aversion to the
people of China may move the government of that country to take notice of the
feeling in a way that might prove of a considerable damage to us."</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Daily Commercial Bulletin</i>, of New York, in the course of a
long and well considered article on "China as a Market for Americans,"
after commenting on the enterprising tendencies of the
present government of China, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is absolutely certain, that the opening up of China, with its enormous population,
must, despite native views to the contrary, mean a great impetus to her
foreign trade. The railroad ordered to be made will be followed by similar enterprises
in other directions. The interior of China, of which we know so little, and
the inhabitants of which know still less about us, will then be brought into contact
with Western manufacturers; and it needs no spirit of prophecy to tell what the
tremendous outcome of that will be. With an area of about 5,000,000 square miles,
and a population of over 400,000,000 souls, the possibilities of international trade
with the Chinese Empire in future generations are altogether beyond calculation.</p>

<p>In this connection it will be well to examine our own position with regard to the
commerce of China. A return recently issued by the Maritime Customs Office of
that country gives the imports of foreign merchandise (apart from the junk trade
with Hong Kong and Macao) for the year 1888 as $130,000,000—an increase on
1887 of 11 per cent. This improvement is part of a continuous growth, as the
imports for the following years show.</p>

<table style="width: 15em;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">- 6 -</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The increase in the six years is thus no less than 43 per cent. Of the total imports
last year, cotton goods represent $55,000,000, or 42 per cent. Our exports
to China (exclusive of Hong Kong) were as follows:</p>

<p class="tdc">YEAR ENDING JUNE 30</p>

<table style="width: 15em;">
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">1883</td>
  <td class="tdr">$4,100,000</td>

</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">1888</td>
  <td class="tdr">4,600,000</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>These exports are made up almost entirely of cotton goods and petroleum.
The exports of the former were greatest in 1887, when they reached $5,180,000,
and of the latter in 1886, when they reached $2,400,000. For the year 1889 it is
expected that the volume of imports into China will show the rate of expansion
well maintained. For the year ending 30th June last our exports of cotton goods
have fallen to $1,500,000, and of petroleum to $900,000—a decrease of 71 and 61
per cent, respectively from the best figures shown during the preceding six years.
Thus, not only have we had no share in the increased imports into China, but
have lost ground absolutely as well as relatively. In both leading divisions the
decline can in some degree be traced to the natural effects of successful competition
of other countries, notably Great Britain in cottons, and Russia in petroleum.
It is certain, however, that it has been accelerated by the resentment aroused in
China by our anti-Chinese legislation. The position demands the attention of our
government as well as of our manufacturers, and we believe that when it is fully
realized steps will be taken to regain the friendly interests of a nation whose possibilities
are well nigh as great as our own.</p>
</div>

<p>The Japan <i>Gazette</i>, of Yokohama, 26th September, in a long
article on "The United States and China," referring to reported
measures of retaliation on the part of China for the treatment of the
Chinese in the United States, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is not easy to discover that any other course than the one which formed the
subject matter of the conference remains for China to adopt as a counter thrust for
the humiliation and indignity America has cast upon her. It is far from our desire
to say that the United States was not perfectly justified in adopting the measure
she did to prevent the celestial octopus stretching its vicious self over her territory.
Justification in the highest existed. Chinese immigration thither had assumed
alarming proportions and it was characterized by all those damning features ever
associated with the Chinese element. The danger is one which faces America
just as it has faced the Colonies, and it is well for those of our own color that it
should be opposed by the best modes of defense. Only one result is aimed at, but
it may be possible to achieve all that is desired by a plurality of methods. Perhaps
America has not adopted the right one; at any rate she has clearly ruffled Chinese
dignity. Such a decided act as hers, although, as we think, justified, was perhaps
impolitic as the result indicates.</p>
</div>

<p>With these expressions of opinion as to the effect of the act
and its policy, as an introduction, we now proceed to give as briefly
as possible a record of the events that have led up to the present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">- 7 -</span>
condition of our relations with the Chinese and to the passage of
the Act referred to in its present form, in the Autumn of 1888.</p>

<p>The discovery of gold in California in 1848, an event which
perhaps more then any other in recent times has contributed to the
commercial and industrial growth of nations, first brought the people
of the United States into social and business relations with the
Chinese. Attracted by reports of the wealth to be found in our
mines and excited by the return of some of the pioneers of their
race, bearing in their hands the golden fruit of their toils, the
stream of immigration began. For twenty years it grew in volume
until, in 1876, the number of Chinese in California was about
100,000. A very much greater number had come to this country,
but a large proportion of them had returned to their homes, and
at the close of this period of twenty-seven years it appears from
the census reports that the number returning was nearly as large
as the number arriving.</p>

<p>The growth of this Chinese immigration directed attention to
the diplomatic relations between the government of China and the
United States. The first treaty with China in 1844, and the second
treaty of 1858, were limited to the purpose of protecting American
citizens doing business in China. The important right secured by
these treaties was that by which Americans charged with offenses
should be tried by United States laws in Consular Courts. These
treaties related exclusively to the rights and privileges of Americans
in China and defined the ports or limits within which they might
reside for the purposes of trade.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton Fish, our Secretary of State, in a communication
to Mr. Bancroft, then American Minister at Berlin, dated August
31, 1869, says: "The communication between China and the outside
world was merely confined to the trading points. With the
intellects that rule that nation of 450 millions of people, with the
men who gave it its ideas and directed its policy, with its vast internal
industries, with its great agricultural population, the traders
consuls and functionaries of the ports rarely came into contact except
in the contact of war.</p>

<p>The European Chinese policy was one of isolation, inasmuch as
it only sought the development of a foreign trade at certain particular
ports, and of disintegration, as it practically ignored the
Central government and made war upon the provinces to redress
its grievances and enforce its demands."</p>

<p>This describes the relations between China and the outside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">- 8 -</span>
world, at the time the emigration of her people to our Pacific
coast was rapidly increasing, and beginning to excite general interest.
It may therefore be readily conceived that when it was
announced that Mr. Burlingame, American Minister to China, had
resigned his commission to accept the post of Ambassador of China
to the Western nations, it attracted universal attention. When it
became known that this appointment was for the purpose of introducing
China into the family of civilized nations, and of removing
the barriers which had hitherto excluded her from intercourse with
the great nations of the world, attention became curiosity and
curiosity was supplanted by a general sense of rejoicing at this
sudden conversion to the ways of modern civilization of a nation
comprising a quarter of the population of the globe.</p>

<p>Mr. Burlingame, in his capacity as Ambassador of China, negotiated
a treaty with the United States, described by Mr. Fish in the
letter above referred to, as follows: "The treaty negotiated by Mr.
Burlingame and his colleagues was a long step in another direction.
It came voluntarily from China and placed that power in theory on
the same diplomatic footing with the nations of the Western world.
It recognized the imperial government as the power to withhold
or to grant further commercial privileges, as also the power whose
duty it is to enforce the peaceful enjoyment of the rights already
conferred."</p>

<p>"While it confirms the extra-territorial jurisdiction inferred
by former treaties upon European and American functionaries over
the persons and property of their countrymen, it recognizes at the
same time the territorial integrity of China, and prevents such jurisdiction
from being stretched beyond its original purpose. While it
leaves in China the sovereign power of granting to foreigners hereafter
the right to construct lines of railroads and telegraphs, of
opening mines, of navigating the rivers of the Empire with steamers
and of otherwise increasing the outlets of its wealth by the
use of the appliances of Western civilization, it contemplates that
China shall avail herself of these appliances by reasonable concessions
to be made as public necessities, and as the power of the
government to influence public opinion will permit."</p>

<p>Such was the view held by our Secretary of State of the value
and importance of the Burlingame Treaty of July, 1868. And
pending its ratification by the Chinese government, which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">- 9 -</span>
delayed for more than a year, Mr. Fish expressed his solicitude in
the following language:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The President thinks it would be well to have defined by
law, as soon as possible, the relations that are hereafter to exist
between the United States and China. Many considerations call
for this. Every month brings thousands of Chinese immigrants
to the Pacific coast Already they have crossed the great mountains
and are beginning to be found in the interior of the continent.
By their assiduity, patience and fidelity, and by their intelligence,
they earn the good will and confidence of those who employ
them. We have good reason to think that this thing will continue
and increase. On the other hand, in China, there will be an increase
in the resident American and European population, not by
any means commeasurate with the growth of Chinese immigration
to this country, but corresponding with the growth of our
country, with the development of its resources on the Pacific Slope,
and with the new position in the commerce of the world which it
takes with the completion of the Pacific Railroad."</p>
</div>

<p>There is reason to believe that the sentiments expressed by
our Secretary of State, in 1869, and by him attributed to President
Grant, were at that time the sentiments of the whole country,
including the Pacific coast.</p>

<p>The special features of the Burlingame Treaty may be found
in Articles V. and VI. In its other parts it substantially confirmed
the provisions of former treaties. Article V. contains the remarkable
provision by which both parties "recognize the inherent and
inalienable right of man to change his home and allegiance, and
also the natural advantage of the free migration and emigration of
citizens and subjects from one country to another for purposes of
curiosity, of trade, or as permanent residents."</p>

<p>This was peculiarly an American doctrine which had for many
years been a vexed subject of diplomatic negotiations with European
countries, and its recognition in the Burlingame Treaty was naturally
regarded as a great triumph. The same article provided
for the prevention of involuntary emigration, which, under the
name "Coolie Trade," had aroused the indignation of the civilized
world.</p>

<p>Article VI. gave citizens of the United States in China all the
rights and privileges of citizens of the most favored nations, and
to Chinese in this country the same rights as were enjoyed by subjects
of the most favored nations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">- 10 -</span></p>

<p>President Hayes in his veto massage of Mar. 1, 1879, says: "The
principal feature on the Burlingame Treaty was its attention to and
its treatment of the Chinese immigration, and the Chinese, forming,
or as they should form, a part of our population." "Up to this
time our uncovenanted hospitality, our fearless liberality of citizenship,
our equal and comprehensive justice to all inhabitants,
whether they abjured their foreign nationality or not, our civil
freedom, and our religious toleration, had made all comers welcome,
and, under these protections, the Chinese, in considerable
numbers, had made their lodgment on our soil." "The Burlingame
Treaty undertakes to deal with this situation, and its Vth and
VIth articles embrace its most important provisions in this regard,
and the main stipulations in which the Chinese government has
secured an obligatory protection of its subjects within our territory."</p>

<p>In other words, the United States in consideration of certain
obligations assumed by China, entered into a solemn contract to
treat the Chinese coming to this country, as they always had been
treated, and as immigrants from all other countries had always
been treated.</p>

<p>What had always been our custom became a treaty obligation
in return for certain covenants on the part of China, the chief of
which was that all involuntary emigration was to be forbidden and
penalties imposed to prevent it, and punish those who should in
violation of the law engage in it.</p>

<p>Senator Morton of Indiana, said, "that this treaty was regarded
by the whole nation as a grand triumph of American diplomacy
and principles, and Mr. Burlingame as a benefactor of his country."</p>

<p>It is essential to observe that at the time of the approval of
this treaty, and its recognition as a beneficial act for this country,
the Chinese had been here in great numbers for more than twenty
years. The record of their arrival as found in the Report of the
Joint Special Committee of Congress, in 1876, shows that the
whole number of Chinese in the United States at that time was
about 114,000, and in California about 94,000. Another witness
makes it about 4,000 less. It also appears that the largest arrivals
were in the years 1848 to 1854. In that period the arrivals were
over 50,000 and the departures about 8,000, leaving in the country
at the beginning of 1855 about 42,000—or nearly half the whole
number in California in 1876, twenty years later. In 1869, the
number had reached about 70,000, or three-fourths the number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">- 11 -</span>
found in California in 1876. It is therefore obvious that the
people of California and of the whole United States had had prior
to the approval of the Burlingame Treaty, ample opportunity to
become familiar with the character of the Chinese. Nevertheless
the treaty was welcomed which protected them in this country
and encouraged their immigration.</p>

<p>This reflection brings us to one of the most remarkable changes
of public sentiment on the Pacific coast, which has probably ever
characterized a people, a change as sudden as it was remarkable,
and as universal as it was sudden. Almost immediately after the
confirmation of the Burlingame Treaty, in 1869, murmurs began to
be heard in California, hostile to the Chinese. As early as December
22, 1869, an appeal was made to Congress for legislation to
restrict Chinese immigration. Each successive Congress was
appealed to but without effect until the 44th Congress, in 1876,
appointed a joint committee to take testimony, and in 1877 passed a
resolution calling on the President to "open negotiations with the
Chinese government for the purpose of modifying the provisions
between the two countries and restricting the same to commercial
purposes." At the same time the Legislature of California
appointed a special committee to investigate the subject and prepare
a memorial to Congress. It was issued August, 1877, as an
"Address to the people of the United States, upon the social,
moral and political effect of Chinese immigration." This address
contains evidence to prove that "the Chinaman is a factor hostile
to the prosperity, the progress and the civilization of the American
people."</p>

<p>The report of the Joint Committee of Congress, February, 1877,
which fills a large volume of nearly 1,300 pages, contains similar
evidence in greater detail, showing the unfitness of the Chinese, by
their social and moral characteristics, by their religion and by their
peculiar and apparently ineradicable desire to return to their native
country, dead or alive—to form part of our population, to amalgamate
with or be absorbed into it, as other races have been. It points
out the fact that they come here, as a rule, without wives or children,
live apart from other races, form no attachments to the soil or to our
people, and by their lack of family relations and children present
no facilities for association with our people, and no opportunities
for growing into conditions or habits, which would tend to make
them ultimately homogeneous with us. Furthermore, it was
claimed by many witnesses, that the Chinese were a festering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">- 12 -</span>
mass of corruption in the body politic, threatening to destroy the
moral and physical health of the people, and that there were no
other means of preventing this result than for the government to
intervene, and by some modification of the treaty with China, check
Chinese immigration.</p>

<p>The evidence on the other side was no less complete, showing
the virtue, integrity, cleanliness, industry, skill, peaceableness, and,
in general, the desirableness of the Chinese as an industrial element
of our population.</p>

<p>It must be acknowledged that the witnesses on this side of the
case were, as a rule, of the highest personal character, men of great
intelligence, familiar, by practical relations, with the Chinese in
various capacities, and many of them men who had learned the
character of the Chinese by long residence in China.</p>

<p>It is also apparent that the conduct of the examination was in
a spirit of bitter hostility to the Chinese and with a determination
rather to prove the case against them than to ascertain the truth.
The report as presented to Congress by Senator Sargent, of California,
representing a majority of the joint committee, is adverse to
the Chinese and recommends immediate steps to restrict the privileges
granted by the treaty. On the other hand Senator Oliver P.
Morton, the chairman of the committee, who heard patiently all
the testimony, in a fragmentary paper, intended as the basis for a
minority report, which was printed by order of the Senate after Mr.
Morton's death, took strong grounds in favor of maintaining the
treaty. He says: "The testimony shows that the intellectual
capacity of the Chinese is fully equal that of white people. Their
ability to acquire the mechanic arts and to imitate every process
and form of workmanship, ranks very high, and was declared by
many witnesses to be above that of white people, and their general
intellectual power to understand and master any subject presented
to the human understanding, to be quite equal to that of any other
race" His conclusions are briefly embodied in the following sentences:
"As Americans, charged with the administration of the
laws by which equal rights and protection shall be extended to all
races and conditions, we cannot now safely take a new departure
which, in another form, shall resurrect and re-establish those
odious distinctions of race which brought upon us the late civil
war, and from which we fondly hoped that God in his providence
had delivered us forever." "If the Chinese in California were white
people, being in all other respects what they are, I do not believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">- 13 -</span>
that the complaints and warfare against them would have existed
to any considerable extent." "Their difference in color, dress,
manners and religion have, in my judgment, more to do with this
hostility than their alleged vices, or any actual injury to the white
people of California." He further adds, by way of suggestion of a
remedy for their persecution: "Complete protection can be given
them only by allowing them to become citizens and acquire the
rights of suffrage when their votes would become important in elections
and their persecutions in great part converted into kindly
solicitation."</p>

<p>These are the opinions of one who was doubtless the largest
minded man on the committee, and who, being free from local
influences and prejudices, and evidently aiming only at conclusions
which were sustained by the testimony, justly commands from
the disinterested inquirer, the highest degree of confidence.</p>

<p>We have been thus prolix in comments upon the report of the
joint committee, because it was the basis of all subsequent acts
relating to the Chinese, and must be considered as the most complete
testimony on the Chinese question on both sides.</p>

<p>It would be impracticable to follow the debates on this question
which have to a greater or less extent occupied the attention of Congress
and the country from the time this report was made down to
the present day. On the one side was urged our duty to humanity
and to the principles of human liberty on which our government is
founded; the importance of maintaining friendly relations with
China, for religious and moral as well as for commercial purposes;
the unreasonableness of the fears which prevailed in some quarters
that the Chinese would overrun this country, or reduce its standard
of civilization. It was shown that the emigration was limited
to a district of China about the size of Connecticut, and for reasons
founded upon peculiarities of language and inherited habits, would
never affect the population of China outside of this region. It was
shown that this class of Chinese was distinguished for thrift, integrity
and cleanliness.</p>

<p>On the other side while admitting the importance of the general
propositions as to our treaty obligations, and humanitarian
reasons, the arguments and facts brought forward by the friends
of the Chinese were diametrically contradicted. The coming of
the Chinese was denounced as a horrible invasion, tending to dishonor
labor, corrupt our morals and disintegrate our civilization.
Into the discussion from the start has been injected a political<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">- 14 -</span>
issue, which has determined every vote taken in Congress; the
issue as to the partisan control of the Pacific States. To illustrate
this fact we call to mind the famous Morey letter, a forgery, imputed
to Gen. Garfield in October, 1880, in which he was made to favor
the importation of Chinese labor, in order to defeat his election.
Both Republicans and Democrats feared the consequence of opposing
the wishes of the people of California and the adjoining
States. And no one could doubt what their wishes were respecting
Chinese immigration. For this reason, from the outset, the
veto of the President has been the only barrier in defense of our
treaty obligations and of the rights of the Chinese in the United
States.</p>

<p>The next move in the direction of a change was a resolution by
Congress, early in 1878, requesting President Hayes "to open correspondence
immediately with a view of securing a change or
abrogation of all stipulations in existing treaties which permit unlimited
immigration of Chinese to the United States." This resolution
never reached the President, and therefore nothing was
done. Early in 1879 the Committee on Education and Labor introduced
"an act to restrict the immigration of Chinese to the
United States." This was the first of a series of acts passed for the
same purpose. It limited the number of Chinese passengers by
any one vessel to fifteen, and was vetoed by President Hayes for
the general reason that it was in violation of treaty stipulations.
He adds the special reason that, "the recession of emigration from
China to the Pacific coast relieves us from any apprehension that
the treatment of the subject by the proper course of diplomatic
negotiations will introduce any new features of discontent or disturbance
among the communities directly affected," and he deprecates
violation of our treaties with China as more injurious than
any local inconveniences.</p>

<p>In reference to this last mentioned act, a special meeting of the
Chamber of Commerce was held on the 27th of February, 1879, at
which earnest addresses were made in opposition to the passage of
the Act by Messrs. A. A. Low, Wm. H. Fogg, Elliot C. Cowdin,
Jackson S. Shultz, Charles Watrous and Isaac Phillips.</p>

<p>Resolutions, embodying this sentiment and calling on the Government
to fulfil its treaty stipulations, were unanimously adopted.</p>

<p>Similar resolutions were adopted in various places, chiefly along
the Atlantic coast.</p>

<p>Meantime the voters of California, in September, 1879, in conformity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">- 15 -</span>
with a recent law of the State, met at the polls to express
the wishes of the people respecting Chinese immigration. For
Chinese immigration there were cast 883 votes, against it were
154,638 votes, and the entire vote of the State was cast within less
than 4,000. In Nevada the vote was 183 for and 17,259 against it.</p>

<p>In March, 1880, the Committee of the House of Representatives
on the Causes of the Depression of Labor, submitted a report
attributing much of the existing trouble to the presence of
the Chinese. Although the minority condemned this view, and
charged the majority with prejudice, the report resulted in an
inquiry addressed to the President respecting the step% if any,
which had been taken to change the Burlingame Treaty. To
this Secretary Evarts replied that no definite measures had been
concluded, but "that preparation had been laid for a conclusive
disposition of the matter." Following this, at an early date, came
the appointment of James B. Angel, John F. Swift and Wm. Henry
Trescot, Commissioners Plenipotentiary of the United States to
China, for the purpose of securing, by friendly negotiation, the
desired modification of the Burlingame Treaty. They were cordially
received by the Chinese government, and "two Chinese
Commissioners of high rank and large influence, both members of
the Privy Council of State," were appointed, with full powers
to consider their demands. After a comparatively brief discussion,
which was marked on the part of the Chinese government by
courtesy and by a friendly desire to treat with great consideration
the wishes of the United States, the modifications were agreed
to and a new treaty was signed on the 17th of November, 1880.</p>

<p>Secretary Evarts, in a letter to the President dated Jan. 10, 1881,
says: "The treaty submitted settles the questions raised between
the two countries, in a manner alike honorable and satisfactory to
both. While preserving to the subjects of China engaged in mercantile
pursuits, in study, in teaching or in travel for curiosity, the
right of free intercourse with this country, the Chinese government
has recognised, in the government of the United States, the
right to regulate, limit and suspend the introduction into its territory
of Chinese labor, whenever in its discretion such introduction
shall threaten the good order of any locality or endanger any
interest." Early in 1881 this treaty became the law of the land
by the approval of the Senate, and was followed in the same year
by an act passed in the Senate, "to execute certain treaty stipulations
relating to the Chinese." This act provided that, "from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">- 16 -</span>
and after the expiration of ninety days next after the passage of
this act and until the expiration of twenty years, the coming of
Chinese laborers to the United States be and the same is hereby
suspended." The remainder of the act provides for the execution
of this purpose, and defines the word laborers to mean both "skilled
and unskilled laborers and Chinese employed in mining." This
measure was thoroughly debated in both branches of Congress
and these discussions cover the entire controversy. President
Arthur returned the bill to the Senate, April 4, 1882, with his objections,
which were substantially that, while the treaty gave the
United States the right to limit and regulate the immigration of
Chinese laborers, it did not authorize a prohibition, and that suspension
for twenty years was essentially prohibition. This veto
message is a valuable statement of the importance of maintaining
friendly relations with China, and sustaining the traditional
repute of the United States for good faith in its relations with
foreign nations. It concludes as follows: "It may be that the
great and paramount interest of protecting our labor from Asiatic
competition, may justify us in a permanent adoption of this policy.
But it is wiser in the first place to make a shorter experiment, with
a view hereafter of maintaining permanently only such features as
time and experience may commend."</p>

<p>The bill failed to pass over the veto, and on May 6, 1883,
another bill was passed and approved by the President, substantially
the same as the previous one, but substituting ten years for
the twenty years, provided for in the original measure. It should be
stated that it was provided in this act that Chinese laborers in this
country, or on the way to the United States at the time of the passage
of the act, should have the right to leave or return to the
United States on adequate proof of the facts. This act seems
to have been satisfactory to the Chinese government, and together
with measures previously adopted, checked the increase of Chinese
immigration. The census of 1880 gives the total Chinese population
in the United States at 105,000, of which 75,000 were in California.
And from the evidence of their immigration since 1880, it appears
that the arrivals are offset by their departures, so that there has
been no material increase of our Chinese labor population since
1876. It is stated officially that in the three years ending Aug. 1,
1885, "the Chinese population in the country decreased by fully
20,000," a conclusion sustained by the steady advance of Chinese
labor on the Pacific coast during that period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">- 17 -</span></p>

<p>But complaints were continually coming from the Pacific
coast of the violation of the provisions of the act of 1882, and
supplementary measures were adopted from time to time to enforce
its provisions, always however keeping within the limits of our
treaty obligations. The act itself came before the U. S. Supreme
Court in California, which held it to be within the limits of the
Treaty of 1880.</p>

<p>A portion of Mr. Justice Field's opinion, Sept. 24, 1883, in the
case referred to is interesting as stating the most enlightened view
of the people of California on the subject of Chinese immigration.
He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the treaty of July 28, 1868, commonly known as the Burlingame Treaty, the
contracting parties declare that "they recognize the inherent and inalienable
right of man to change his home and allegiance; and also the mutual advantage
of free migration and emigration of their citizens and subjects respectively from
one country to the other for purposes of curiosity, of trade, or as permanent residents."
In its sixth article they declare that citizens of the United States visiting
or residing in China shall enjoy the same privileges, immunities, or exemptions
in respect to travel or residence as may be enjoyed by the citizens or subjects of
the most favored nations; and reciprocally, Chinese subjects visiting or residing
In the United States shall enjoy the same privileges, immunities, or exemptions in
respect to travel or residence as may there be enjoyed by citizens or subjects of the
most favored nations.</p>

<p>Before these articles were adopted a great number of Chinese had emigrated
to this State [California], and after their adoption the Immigration largely increased.
But notwithstanding the favorable provisions of the treaty, it was found
impossible for them to assimilate with our people. Their physical characteristics
and habits kept them as distinct and separate as though still living in China.
They engaged in all the industries and pursuits of the State; they came in competition
with white laborers in every direction; and their frugal habits, the absence
of families, their singular ability to live in narrow quarters without apparent injury
to health, their contentment with the simplest fare, gave them In this competition
great advantages over our laborers and mechanics (7 Sawyer, 549). They
could live with apparent comfort on what would prove almost starvation to white
men. Our laborers and mechanics are not content, and never should be, with the
means of bare subsistence. They must have something beyond this for the comforts
of a home, the support of a family, and the education of children. Competition
with Chinese labor under the conditions mentioned was necessarily Irritating
and exasperating, and often led to collisions between persons of the two races. It
was seen that without some restriction upon the immigration of Chinese, white
laborers and mechanics would be driven from the State. They looked, therefore,
with great apprehension toward the crowded millions of China and of the adjacent
islands In the Pacific, and felt that there was more than a possibility of such multitudes
coming as to make a residence here unendurable. It was perceived by
thoughtful men, looking to the possibilities of the future, that the Immigration of
the Chinese must be stopped if we would preserve this land for our people and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">- 18 -</span>
their posterity, and protect the laborer from a competition degrading in its character
and ruinous to his hopes of material and social advancement. There went up,
therefore, most urgent appeals from the Pacific coast to the government of the
United States to take such measures as would stop the further coming of Chinese
laborers. The effect of these appeals was the sending of commissioners to China
to negotiate for a modification of the Treaty of 1868. The Supplementary Treaty
of 1880 was the result. It authorized legislation restricting the immigration of
Chinese laborers to the United States whenever our government should be of the
opinion that their coming would affect or threaten the interest of the country or
endanger its good order, but expressly stipulated that its provisions should not
apply to other classes coming to the United States.</p>
</div>

<p>It may be mentioned here that among the decisions which grew
out of this act, was one to the effect that nothing therein prevented
the transit of Chinese passengers across the country, whether
laborers or others.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the plain evidence that the acts of Congress
to execute the Treaty of 1880 were effectual and that former causes
of alarm growing out of the rapid increase of the Chinese laboring
population had been substantially removed, the irritation seemed
not wholly to have ceased, and it was made the ground of further
legislation hostile to the Chinese, though always with protestations
of good faith, and conformity with treaty obligations. Nevertheless
these measures and their execution were often the subject of
friendly remonstrance on the part of the Chinese Minister at
Washington, who in a letter to Secretary Bayard, March 9, 1886,
claims that "the guarantees so explicitly set forth in the treaty
stipulations made between China and the United States have not
been made good." He adds politely that "he feels sure that the
government of the United States would not intentionally injure its
established reputation by even a seeming neglect to provide the
means for the complete fulfilment of all treaty obligations."</p>

<p>We now come to the year 1888, during which was to be determined
whether the Democratic administration of the government
should be continued. Both of the great political parties began
early to manœuvre for position and to plan for the capture of
votes. Among the questions which had in previous years largely
determined the issue in the Pacific States, was the question of
Chinese immigration.</p>

<p>In March, 1888, a resolution was passed in the Senate and
transmitted to the President, "That in view of the difficulties and
embarrassments that have attended the regulation of the immigration
of Chinese laborers to the United States, under the limitations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">- 19 -</span>
of our treaty with China, the President of the United States be
requested to negotiate a treaty with the Emperor of China, containing
a provision that no Chinese laborer shall enter the United
Sates."</p>

<p>To this, the President replied that "negotiation for a treaty
was commenced many months ago and has since continued," and
he expressed, "the hope and expectation that a treaty will soon be
concluded concerning the immigration of Chinese laborers, which
will meet the wants of our people, and the approbation of the
Senate."</p>

<p>After prolonged discussion between Mr. Bayard, our Secretary
of State, and Mr. Chang Yen Hoon, the Chinese Minister at Washington,
a new treaty was agreed upon on the 12th of March, 1888,
and approved by the Senate in the course of a few weeks afterwards.
This treaty declares: "Whereas the government of China,
in view of the antagonisms and much deprecated and serious disorders
to which the presence of Chinese laborers has given rise in
the United States, desires to prohibit the emigration of such
laborers from China to the United States," and proceeds to agree
in Art. I., that for a period of twenty years, the coming of Chinese
laborers shall be absolutely prohibited, with certain exceptions,
including such as may have wives or property amounting to $1,000
in this country, and shall return here after an absence of not more
than one year.</p>

<p>It provides for the maintenance of former stipulations concerning
other classes of Chinese, and that laborers may have the
right of transit across the country. It also provides that Chinese
of all classes in the country shall have all the rights and privileges
of the most favored nations, except that of naturalization, and the
United States agrees to protect them in such rights.</p>

<p>This treaty was to remain in force twenty years and be continued
indefinitely after that time unless formal notice should be
given by either side of intention to terminate it.</p>

<p>On the 12th of May, 1888, the Chinese Minister wrote to Mr.
Bayard that he had sent the treaty to his government for ratification.</p>

<p>On the 5th of September the Senate by resolution inquired of
the President "whether the recent treaty with China had been
ratified by the Emperor."</p>

<p>In reply to this the President transmitted dispatches from our
Minister in China, first, to the effect that no "information had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">- 20 -</span>
received," and, second, that the "treaty had been postponed for
further deliberation."</p>

<p>Pending the further deliberation of which our Minister in
China had given notice, a bill was introduced in the Senate of the
United States to enact into law the provisions of the proposed
treaty and provide for their execution. This bill was approved on
the 13th of September, 1888; and, as if not satisfied with this act
of disrespect to a friendly government, which had frankly conceded
our demands, and was at the time deliberating upon the formal
approval of the treaty which accorded them, another bill was introduced
into Congress for similar purposes, but still more aggravating
to the Chinese government It was passed and finally
approved October 1, 1888. It provides "that from and after the
passage of this act it shall be unlawful for any Chinese laborer
who shall at any time heretofore have been, or who may now or
hereafter be, a resident within the United States, and who shall have
departed or shall depart therefrom and shall not have returned
before the passage of this act, to return to or remain in the
United States; that no certificate of identity, etc., shall be issued,
and every certificate heretofore issued is declared void, and the
Chinese laborer claiming admission by virtue thereof shall not be
permitted to enter the United States." It further repeals all parts
of the act of 1882 which may be inconsistent with this act.</p>

<p>In a message to Congress, dated October 1, 1888, in which
President Cleveland signifies his approval of the act just above
referred to, he enters into a formal apology for the conduct of the
government in refusing to await the deliberations of the Chinese
government The President states that on the 21st September he
had received a telegram from our Minister in China "announcing
the refusal to exchange ratifications unless further discussion
could be had," and that in view of this refusal "an emergency
had arisen in which the government of the United States is
called upon to act in self defense by the exercise of its legislative
power."</p>

<p>The official correspondence submitted with this message shows
that while the general purpose of the treaty was approved by the
Chinese government some of the details caused dissatisfaction
to the Chinese people, and for that reason the Chinese government
desired that the treaty should be reconsidered.</p>

<p>A communication from the Chinese legation in Washington,
dated Sept 25, 1888, informs Secretary Bayard that the Chinese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">- 21 -</span>
Minister would return to Washington in twenty-two or twenty-three
days to reopen the discussion of some of these details and
hopes, from the cordial relations which have hitherto existed
between the two governments, that satisfactory conclusions will be
reached.</p>

<p>But on the 18th of September, a week before the above correspondence
took place, Secretary Bayard sent the following dispatch
to our Minister in China:—"Denby, Minister, Peking: The bill
has passed both houses of Congress for total exclusion of Chinese,
and awaits President's approval. Public feeling on the Pacific
coast excited in favor of it, and situation critical. Impress on
government of China necessity for instant decision in the interest
of treaty relations and amity. Bayard." Imagine the effect of
this lash and spur applied to the stately and exalted Emperor of
China and his dignified counsellors, especially in view of the
courtesy and conciliation with which they had uniformly treated
our government and its representatives.</p>

<p>Minister Denby replied, on Sept 21st, that the Chinese government
refused ratification unless after further consideration of
details, and this it was preparing to give, as shown by the correspondence
of Sept. 26th, already quoted.</p>

<p>The extraordinary haste with which our government proceeded
thus to affront its ancient friend—to override its formal treaty
stipulations, and substitute arbitrary legislation for diplomatic
negotiations—presents a spectacle to which no American can well
recur without a sense of mortification that the government of the
United States should have shown itself so far inferior in courtesy
and justice to the government of a nation, ordinarily, though
erroneously, considered barbarian.</p>

<p>It is difficult to discover the emergency to which the President
refers as his justification. It is evident that under existing treaties
with China and the laws enacted in pursuance thereof, the objections
to Chinese immigration had been substantially removed.
The difficulties which remained were only in details, to secure the
more perfect execution of the laws. The Chinese had ceased to
come in dangerous numbers. Those who were here were spreading
over the country, learning our language and usages, and everywhere
proving themselves a quiet, law abiding and inoffensive
people. The complaints, which formerly were heard, of their
depressing influence on wages and labor, had ceased to be frequent
or urgent. The Chinese were found to be apt in demanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">- 22 -</span>
high wages, as they were commendable in saving them. Nowhere
in the country was there any pressing demand for this class legislation.
It can be explained only on the theory that a presidential
election was pending, and that a demonstration must be made to
capture the vote of the Pacific States. It may be said that these
harsh and unnecessary measures, which were adopted just before
the election of 1888, were not vigorously opposed by the anti-administration
party, for reasons similar to those which inspired
the promoters of those measures.</p>

<p>To close this already too lengthy statement of the circumstances
which have led up to our present relations with China, it
may be added that the Supreme Court of the United States has
this year affirmed the constitutionality of the Chinese Exclusion
Act, so called, on the broad ground of the power of Congress to
abrogate a treaty. And it cannot be denied that the act itself, and
the decision of the Supreme Court, were received with great satisfaction
by the people of California: On this subject the San Francisco
<i>Chronicle</i>, perhaps the best exponent of public opinion on the
Pacific coast, and in politics an earnest Republican, concludes as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>So it is settled by the highest authority in the land that the Chinese laborer
cannot come to the United States to compete with our own workingmen on our
own soil. The effect of this decision cannot fail to be salutary. It must result in
dignifying labor by removing it from enforced competition with what is virtually
servile labor; for as surely as debased coin will drive honest coin out of circulation,
so surely will the presence of servile labor in a community cast a stigma
upon free labor and drive it out of the market.</p>

<p>Now the process of elimination can begin in earnest, and in place of the
departing coolie we may look for that kind of labor which builds up a community
and adds to the growth and prosperity of a nation. Now we may with a dear
conscience invite labor from the older States, and insure it against being met on
the threshold of California by a horde of Mongolians who can underbid any white
labor and put it to flight. Now the regeneration of California can really begin;
and if we desire to add another annual holiday to our list we may well celebrate
the 13th of May, the day of the final decision of the Chae Chan Ping case.</p>
</div>

<p>In the presence of these convictions, representing the sense
of that part of the American people who have the best opportunity
of knowing the effect of Chinese immigration—and who have at an
earlier day expressed their judgment by the emphatic vote of 800
for and 154,000 against Chinese immigration—there can be no
question as to the propriety of terminating that immigration so far
as it may be offensive to that important part of this nation which it
most closely affects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">- 23 -</span></p>

<p>But with this acknowledgement our approval of the anti-Chinese
measures of the late administration ceases. And we do not
hesitate to express profound regret that it was found expedient to
abandon the ordinary and regular methods of international negotiation
to secure the desired results and substitute for them the
arbitrary decrees of legislation. Especially is this action of our
government to be regretted in view of the friendly attitude of the
Chinese government, which had entertained with perfect cordiality
our objections to their laboring people in this country and had
shown their willingness to do whatever seemed necessary to remove them.</p>

<p>The effect of this conduct on the part of our government, which
cannot fail to be considered by the Chinese government and people
as arbitrary, discourteous and unfriendly, upon the relations of
our people with the government and people of China is a subject
in regard to which those best qualified to decide seem to have an
almost unanimous opinion. This opinion has already been expressed
in the extracts from American and foreign journals with
which this report was introduced. They may be supplemented by
numerous letters recently received by the Chamber of Commerce
from merchants and missionaries in China. These letters are
submitted to the Chamber herewith. But from some of them a few
brief extracts will be found pertinent.</p>

<p>From Canton, Aug. 22, '89. A gentleman who has been a
resident of that place more than forty years writes: "The government
of China has considered the treaty made by Secretary
Bayard and the Chinese Minister in the most friendly spirit. It
only refused to ratify it owing to some additions made in the Senate
to which the consent of the Chinese Minister had not been
given. There is no doubt that a little diplomacy would have secured
the acceptance of that treaty with very slight modifications."
He says further: "The Chinese government has been very forbearing.
This, however, does not imply that it does not feel the
indignity most keenly. This people will bide their time."</p>

<p>From Shanghai, Aug. 14, '89. The Chamber of Commerce of
Shanghai, to which was submitted various questions on the subject,
says: "It is our opinion that as regards Shanghai, at any
rate, it is incorrectly stated that Chinese officials discriminate between
American and other foreign residents."</p>

<p>From Shanghai, Aug. 9, '89. The Head Master of St John's
College writes: "I do not think that trade interests in Shanghai<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">- 24 -</span>
are in any way affected by the Exclusion Act Among the educated
Chinese there is a strong feeling and the insult to their
nation is deeply felt."</p>

<p>Frazer &amp; Co., merchants, write from Shanghai, Aug. 7, '89.
"According to the best of our knowledge and belief, it is not true,
as reported in the press, that American interests in China are suffering
by reason of this law." "If any feeling of hostility has been
generated in the minds of Chinese officials it has been caused by
the rough and ready way in which the act has been passed."</p>

<p>Rev. Henry V. Noyes, now in this country, but many years
resident of China and a careful observer, writes Aug. 30, '89:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The antagonistic policy pursued by our government of late
toward China, if persisted in, must in the end be injurious to American
interests, both commercial and missionary. The Chinese are a
long remembering as well as a long suffering people, and they understand
well how to use the boycott principle when they consider
it expedient."</p>

<p>Mr. B. C. Henry writes from Canton, Sept. 9, '89: "There is a
widespread feeling that the Chinese are sure to retaliate, and if
their policy of retaliation is not yet divulged it is only because in
their opinion the time has not come to inaugurate it. They are
not likely to forget that glaring injustice."</p>

<p>A clergyman in Shanghai writes Sept. 20, '89: "Although the
Americans were in greater favor than any other people previous to
this obnoxious enactment, our popularity has suffered, and the officers
are sure to discriminate against our people to the advantage
of other nations without, of course, giving the reasons."</p>

<p>In view of the facts here presented, and of the opinion widely
expressed, concerning the effects of the arbitrary action of our government
in the passage of the recent acts for exclusion of Chinese
laborers from the United States, the Committee on Foreign Commerce
and the Revenue Laws would now recommend that measures
be taken by the government of the United States to reopen the
negotiations which were unfortunately interrupted and terminated
by act of Congress approved by President Cleveland, October 1,
1888. It is believed by your committee that the change in the
administration which has taken place since that act was passed,
will readily permit a renewal of negotiations at the point where they
ceased in September, 1888, and that the government of China will
recognize and appreciate favorably a movement on the part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">- 25 -</span>
government of the United States looking to a peaceful and friendly
adjustment of all questions in dispute, and to a restoration of the
cordial good feelings that have always, till now, marked the intercourse
of the two governments.</p>

<p>It is not proposed, nor even suggested, that the government of
the United States should open the way for the revival of Chinese
immigration, in violation of the convictions so long entertained
and so earnestly expressed by our fellow citizens of the Pacific
States.</p>

<p>But it is reasonable to believe from the tenor of the expressions
of Chinese officials and of our own representatives in China, that
if the Chinese government is frankly approached by the government
of the United States, it will cordially respond in the same
spirit, and will willingly enter into negotiations for a treaty agreement
which will be satisfactory to both governments, and put an
end to the bitterness which now seems to endanger the welfare of
American citizens—whether missionaries or merchants—in China,
and to threaten our commercial relations with China which promise
to become of vast importance to our people, with the advancing
culture and development of the Chinese Empire.</p>

<p>In the words of the Hon. John A. Kasson, spoken during the
debates in Congress, in 1882:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is not a debased empire. Its higher authorities are the
peers of European and American statesmen. We have here the
representatives of that people, who are orderly, who are seeking
education, who are in responsible places, who are entitled to respect.</p>

<p>"Let us be careful that we do not forfeit the friendship of a great
empire, to be still greater in the future when she shall have accepted
more and more of the principles of progress which animate
us. Let us take care that we do not forfeit that friendship, and
let us assure that great government of the honesty and good faith
of this government and of the people of the United States."</p>
</div>

<p>Your Committee respectfully recommends the adoption of the
following resolutions:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the President of the United States be and he hereby is respectfully
requested to open negotiations with the Government of China for a peaceful

intercourse.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce be and he is hereby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">- 26 -</span>

<p>On page 8, the word after the phrase, "extra-territorial jurisdiction" was misprinted.
The best guess as to what it says is "inferred". A search of the Internet could not
resolve this question!</p>
